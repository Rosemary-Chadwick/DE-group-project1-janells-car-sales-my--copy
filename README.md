## Jannell's Car Sales

### Introduction
The purpose of this lab is to practice accessing data from different sources, combine them into a database, and query the database to get information for the stakeholders.

#### Part 1
Using the provided BRD and API documentation, you will need to create a table that will hold the data that you retrieve from the API in your postgres database. 


### Part 2
Given the dataset `client_contact_status.csv`, create an ER Diagram that connects this dataset to the previous data you have already stored in the postgres database. Keep in mind the normal forms when creating the tables. 

Next, process the csv data and load that it into your database. 

### Part 3
Create an Excel spreadsheet that meets the business requirements given in the BRD.

### Stretch Goal
Come up with a way to validate the data.  In the real world you will be dealing with many types of sensitive data that, if changed, can cause errors that may cost the company money.  How would you verify that the data coming from the API / CSV is the same data that you put in the database? 

### Presentation
You will create a slide deck covering the following points: 
- Talk about Architectural Decisions
- Talk about any challenges you had to overcome
- Talk about anything that you would do differently
- If there is anything that you tried, but could not get to work, discuss it

### Note
Retain the data you loaded to postgres. It will be needed for future labs.
